# GMTKGameJam2023
The GMTK Game Jam is an annual game making marathon, where individuals and teams try to make a game that fits a theme, in just 48 hours.  Thousands of games are submitted as designers improve their skills, flex their creative muscles, and try to get their game featured on Game Makerâ€™s Toolkit.
